A tool for synchronizing local and remote directories with client-side encryption support.

Synkrotron directly supports client-side encryption of remote directories and is much faster
compared to using other synchronization tools on-top of an additional encryption layer.

Uses rsync for transferring files between directories.
For accessing remote directories, ssh and sshfs are used (the server should support
password-less authentication over ssh).
For encrypting files at the remote location, encfs is used.


Requires Python 3.2 or higher, rsync, ssh/sshfs (for remote directories), and encfs (for
encryption).
